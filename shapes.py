#In this exercise, you will create programs to calculate the areas of different shapes.

#After creating the program, upload it to your repository GitHub on Github.

#Create a file called shapes.py. Inside the file, complete the folowing:

#Calculate the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and then calculate and print the area.
#Calculate the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle, and then calculate and print the area.

#Hint: you can access pi by inserting import math, and then typing in math.pi. We will learn about importing in more detail in a later lesson
#Calculate the area of a triangle. Prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle, and then calculate and print the area.
#Remember to use the appropriate formulas for each shape. Test your programs with different input values to ensure they are working correctly.
